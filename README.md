## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate received.
5. Calculate the voter turnout for each county
6. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
7. Determine the county with the highest turnout
8. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote. 

## Resources
- Data Source: [election_results.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgeroux/Election_Analysis/main/Resources/election_results.csv)
- Software: Python 3.10.4 and Visual Studio Code 1.66.1

## Election Audit Results
-*How many votes were cast in this congressional election?*
-*Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.*
-*Which county had the largest number of votes?*
-*Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.*
-*Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?*

Below is an image of the summarized election results:

## Election Audit Summary
This script can be modified to find the most number of votes for different filters other than candidates and county. If the data included other characteristics, such as demographics and geography, the script can be modified to include these characteristics and the analysis can be broken down even further.

This script can also be modified to determine patterns among the characteristics. We could test the percentage of voters by county against each candidate. This would allow us to see which candidate was the most popular within a county or geographical area.
